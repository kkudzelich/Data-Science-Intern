### Deployment on Flask
* Using the data from the previous weeks, I trained a Machine Learning model (XGBoost) to predict the Profit per Trip, taking into account various features (like "City", "Payment Mode", "Gender", "KM Travelled", "Date", etc.).
* Then I deployed this model (created an API) using the __Flask framework__. This API allows you to use forecasting capabilities through HTTP requests.

You can read about the deployment process and see several examples of using the model in production in the file ['Flask_Deployment_Document.pdf'](https://github.com/kkudzelich/Data-Science-Intern/blob/main/Week%204/Flask_Deployment_Document.pdf).

### Heroku Cloud Deployment
* Using the data and trained XGBoost model from the previous weeks, I performed Cloud Deployment using __Heroku__.

### File Ingestion & Schema Validation
* Firstly, I took large size of data (2GB+) and applied different methods of reading like Dask, Modin, ray and Pandas to check the computational efficiency.
* After that, I performed basic validation on the data columns and then validated the number of columns and column names in the ingested file using YAML.
* Finally, I compressed the csv file into gz format and obtained a summary of the file.

### Project: Healthcare – Persistency of drug
Pharmaceutical company ABC Pharma is interested in identifying the key factors that influence whether patients persist with their medication. Identifying factors that influence persistency is crucial for pharmaceutical companies to improve patient outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and enhance their product offerings.

The objective of this project is to understand and predict the persistency of a drug prescribed by physicians. Persistency, in this context, refers to whether a patient, based on his/her information, will follow the prescribed medication regimen over a certain period.

<b>Tasks</b>
* Problem Description
* Business Understanding
* Project Lifecycle and Deadlines
* Data Collection
* Data Intake Report
