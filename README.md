### Deployment on Flask
* Using the data from the previous weeks, I trained a Machine Learning model (XGBoost) to predict the Profit per Trip, taking into account various features (like "City", "Payment Mode", "Gender", "KM Travelled", "Date", etc.).
* Then I deployed this model (created an API) using the __Flask framework__. This API allows you to use forecasting capabilities through HTTP requests.

You can read about the deployment process and see several examples of using the model in production in the file ['Flask_Deployment_Document.pdf'](https://github.com/kkudzelich/Data-Science-Intern/blob/main/Week%204/Flask_Deployment_Document.pdf).
